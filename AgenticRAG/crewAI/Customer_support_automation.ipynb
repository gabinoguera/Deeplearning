      "Thank you for reaching out to crewAI for assistance with setting up a Crew and kicking it off, specifically inquiring about adding memory to your crew. I appreciate the opportunity to assist you with this important task.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add memory to your crew in CrewAI, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Assemble Your Agents: Define your agents with distinct roles, backstories, and enhanced capabilities like memory usage. You can create agents with memory by setting the memory parameter to True when defining the agent. Here is an example code snippet:\n",
      "```\n",
      "researcher = Agent(\n",
      "    role='Senior Researcher',\n",
      "    goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',\n",
      "    verbose=True,\n",
      "    memory=True,\n",

      "    tools=[search_tool, browser_tool],\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Form the Crew: Combine your agents into a crew, setting the workflow process they'll follow to accomplish the tasks. When forming the crew, you can enable memory for the crew by setting the memory parameter to True. Here is an example code snippet:\n",
      "```\n",
      "crew = Crew(\n",
      "    agents=[researcher, writer],\n",
      "    tasks=[research_task, write_task],\n",

      "    manager_agent=manager\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Kick It Off: Initiate the process with your enhanced crew ready. Ensure that memory is enabled for the crew to utilize memory capabilities during task execution. Here is an example code snippet:\n",
      "```\n",
      "result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in healthcare'})\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can successfully add memory to your crew in CrewAI and leverage memory capabilities for efficient task execution and collaboration within your AI team.\n",

      "Thank you for reaching out to us regarding adding memory to the crew in CrewAI. To enhance the memory of the crew, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the current memory capacity of the crew: Before adding more memory, it is important to know the existing memory capacity of the crew. You can check this information in the settings or specifications of the crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Determine the type of memory required: Different crews may require different types of memory modules. It is crucial to determine the type of memory (e.g. DDR3, DDR4) that is compatible with your crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Purchase the appropriate memory modules: Once you have identified the type of memory required, you can purchase the additional memory modules from a reliable supplier. Make sure to buy memory modules that are compatible with your crew's specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Install the memory modules: To add memory to the crew, you will need to open the crew's casing and locate the memory slots. Carefully insert the new memory modules into the available slots, ensuring they are securely in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Verify the memory upgrade: After installing the new memory modules, you can verify the memory upgrade by checking the crew's system information or using diagnostic tools to confirm that the memory has been successfully added.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you should be able to successfully add memory to the crew in CrewAI. If you encounter any difficulties or have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us for assistance. We are here to help!\n",
